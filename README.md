# Multimodal ACR Pipeline

This repository contains the implementation of a **Multimodal Automatic Content Recognition (ACR)** system that processes real-time video streams, applies action recognition and OCR, and performs zero-shot genre classification using a transformer-based language model.

The codebase has been **tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with Python 3.8.10**.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `client.py` | Raspberry Pi client code. Captures video, runs **MoViNet** action recognition locally, and sends results to the server. |
| `client_only.py` | Standalone version of `client.py` without networking; useful for testing MoViNet locally on Pi. |
| `server.py` | GPU server-side code. Receives multimodal input, applies OCR using **PaddleOCR**, performs genre classification using **BART**, and returns results. |
| `server_only.py` | Standalone version of `server.py` for local testing without client communication. |
| `local_environment.py` | Full pipeline integration that runs entirely on a single local machine for development and testing purposes. |

## üì¶ Environment Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.8.10
- Ubuntu 20.04 (or compatible Linux OS)
- GPU (for running the server with Transformer-based genre classification)

You can install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
